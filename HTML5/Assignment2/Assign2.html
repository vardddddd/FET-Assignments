                    he JavaServer Pages 1.1 specification significantly enhanced the JSP architecture
by making it possible to extend the page authoring environment with custom
tags. Custom tags are XML-like extensions to the syntax and semantics of a JSP
page that are backed by user-written tag handlers. Collections of tags are organized
into tag libraries that can be packaged as JAR files, enabling their functionality to be
easily distributed and installed over any JSP 1.1-compliant servlet engine.
